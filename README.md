# BackEnd Exercises

I follow the course of the University of Turku and create exercises. The frontend is stored on GitLab, while the Backend I keep over here. </br>

The branches represent different projects: </br>

<ol>
  <li>notes-backend = Theory I have followed to create notes-backend NodeJS app</li>
  <li>notes-frontend = Theory I have followed ealier but now connected to the backend project</li>
  </br>
  <li>phonebook-front = App I created to complete exercises from the Part 2</li>
  <li>phonebook-back = App I created to complete exercises 3.1-3.5</li>
  </br>
  <li>more projects to be added...</li>
</ol>
